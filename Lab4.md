## Why is it important to choose a license?

Licensure is important because in a sense, lincenses set a boundary and allows the software to be free, as counterintuitive as that may seem. Licensing is important because it helps users understand the processes and conditions so that they may have the best and most free experience. Additionally, licenses help hold people accountable for maintaining freedom of software as they distribute it for future users that may procure said software. 

### 4. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

It is dangerous to use a project that does not have an explicit license because the terms of usage and modification for the most freedom are not defined. Additionally, if there is no license, there is no guarantee that there is a promise to maintain freedom and usability for future users and future distributions. A license affords accountability for errors that cause the software to be less free, and protects against bad actors that can distribute faulty modifications.

### Why the Web Beat Gopher

Based on the information, I would agree with the author's assertions about the failure to deploy open source properly. The fact that the Gopher developers didn't realize often definitely was detrimental to the project. Additionally, with this, the team was limiting the feedback pool. Additionally, I feel like the fact that there was unmanaged forking of the project entangled and weakened the project. 

### Why do companies pick the licenses that they do?

One of the reasons Linux uses the GPLv2 is so that they can keep track of all modifications to help prevent fragmenting, as well as take in new ideas. This helped keep Linux as one kernel. Other licenses don't necessitate the returning of modified software for it to be brought back. Additionally, the GPL allows for merging, which is important to maintain a kernel. Finally, according to Linus Torvalds, the GPL license, as opposed to the MIT license, allows for users to feel as though they have a support network and community.
